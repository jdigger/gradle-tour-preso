== Overview

. Intro
. Groovy DSL
. Taking Full Control
. Lifecycle
. Software Engineering
. Working With Dependencies
. Misc
. Q & A

== Sample `build.gradle`

[source,groovy]
--
apply plugin: 'java'
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    testCompile "junit:junit:4.12"
}
--

Follow the standard source directory conventions (e.g., `src/main/java`, `src/main/resources`, `src/test/groovy`, etc.)

== Conventions != Bondage

Virtually everything has "`reasonable defaults`", but that's all they are

image::handcuffs.png[role=plain, height=300]

[.smaller]
--
Giving in to the dictates of your build tool isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you're in that kind of a trusting
relationship, then it may be right for you.
--


[%notitle]
== Conventions are Easier

The moment the convention doesn't make things easier for you, you have *_AS MUCH_* control as you want

== What Does That Give You?

[source,bash]
--

== Groovy "`Internal DSL`"

"```build.gradle```" is just a Groovy script bound to an instance of
https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html[`org.gradle.api.Project`] for a nice build DSL

Everything you can do in Groovy (`if`, `for`, calling external services, etc.) are all right there to be used

[%notitle]
== Apache Ant
"```ant```" is a native part of Groovy, so you get extremely tight https://ant.apache.org/[Ant] integration "`for free`"

image::Apache-Ant-logo.svg[role=plain]

== Example of Using Groovy with the DSL

Instead of

[source, groovy]
--
dependencies {
    compile "org.springframework:spring-web:4.1.6.RELEASE"
    compile "org.springframework:spring-context:4.1.6.RELEASE"
    compile "org.springframework:spring-test:4.1.6.RELEASE"
}
--
you can go D.R.Y.
[source, groovy]
--
dependencies {
    ["spring-web", "spring-context", "spring-test"].each {
        compile "org.springframework:${it}:4.1.6.RELEASE"
    }
}
--

== Groovy

There's a good https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/writing_build_scripts.html#groovyBasics[section in the Gradle docs about Groovy you should know]

For the most part, it's essentially Java made simpler

[.smaller]
Optional semicolons, optional method parenthesis, simple list/map creation, closures, etc.

[%notitle]
== Groovy Does Lots of Wonderful Magic

image::magic.jpg[background, size=cover]

[%notitle]
== Mechanics

image::mechanical.jpg[background, size=cover]

[%notitle]
== Pull Back the Curtain

image::curtain.jpg[background, size=cover]

== Closures

[%notitle]
== Not Lambdas

Closures are _similar_ to Java 8's lambdas, but **MUCH** more powerful

[%notitle]
== Delegate

The most important difference for now is the availability of "```delegate```"

[%notitle]
== JS this

[NOTE]
If you know Javascript, it's essentially the same idea as rebinding "```this```"

image::a_blessing_in_disguise.jpg[role=plain, height=300px]

== Simple Closure Scope Example

[source, groovy]
--
class TheDelegate {
    String delegateField = "delegateField"
    String delegateMethod() { "delegateMethod" }
}
class A {
    String classField = "classField"
    String aMethod() { "aMethod" }
    static void main(String[] argv) {
        String methodVariable = "methodVariable"
        Closure closure = {
            println classField
            println methodVariable
            println aMethod()
            println delegateField
            println delegateMethod()
        }
        closure.delegate = new TheDelegate()
        closure.call()
    }
}
--

== "`Resolved`" build.gradle

[source, groovy]
--
apply plugin: 'java'
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    testCompile "junit:junit:4.12"
}
--

Is effectively this (pseudo-)Java
[source, java]
--
project.apply(Collections.singletonMap("plugin", "java"));
project.repositories(new Closure(project.getRepositories()) {
    public void call() {
        ((RepositoryHandler)delegate).jcenter();
    }
});
project.dependencies(new Closure(project.getDependencies()) {
    public void call() {
        // "testCompile" isn't a method on DependencyHandler, so its
        // "methodMissing(..)" is called, translating the call to be
        // a call to "add(..)" instead
        ((DependencyHandler)delegate).add("testCompile", "junit:junit:4.12");
    }
});

[%notitle]
== Great Power

image::great-power.jpg[canvas, size=contain]

== Example of Complex Task

[source,groovy]
include::{proj_root}/build.gradle[tags=task_serve]

== Taking Full Control

== Gradle Wrapper

A shell/batch script that handles bootstrapping your build environment

http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html

== Why Is That A Good Thing?

== Trying to build your project requires just the JDK

There are *_no_* other pre-reqs

== Multiple versions of the build tool are handled transparently

There's no need to have multiple versions installed or tweeking jobs/environment variables on CI machines

== You can upgrade or lock-down the build tool version for a specific project

One benefit is it allows the Gradle team to be very aggressive in adding new features and deprecating old functionality

[%conceal]
== Use the Wrapper

PRO TIP: *_Always_* use the wrapper

image::golden-ticket.jpg[role="plain"]

== Gradle Wrapper Search Script

https://gist.github.com/jdigger/7ff2c25d45eba5a2b585557db374daeb

[source,bash]
--
#!/bin/bash

# PURPOSE
#
# The Gradle wrapper[1] is a simple and convenient way of making Gradle
# builds self-contained and reproducible. However, in multi-project
# builds, it can be cumbersome to type in relative paths e.g.:
#   ./gradlew   # when in root
#   ../gradlew  # when in subdir
#
# This script finds any Gradle wrapper (gradlew) executable in the
# current directory or any directory above it.
#
# DEBUGGING
#
# To observe the search for gradlew and to ensure which one is
# ultimately used, invoke the script with Bash's "-x" option. Below you
# can see the directory traversal at work, finally selecting the
# 'gradlew' script one directory up from where 'gradle' was invoked.
#
#     $ cd /src/my-proj/submod
#     $ bash -x $(which gw) --version
#     + GRADLEW=/src/my-proj/submod/gradlew
#     + GRADLEW=/src/my-proj/gradlew
#     + /src/my-proj/gradlew --version
#     ...
#
#
# [1] http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html

CWD=$PWD
until [ $CWD == / ]; do
    GRADLEW=$CWD/gradlew
    if [ -e $GRADLEW ]; then
        exec $GRADLEW $@
    fi
    CWD=$(dirname $CWD)
done

echo No Gradle wrapper found
exit 1
--

== What About When You Need TOTAL Control?

== Control the build tool, library versions, etc. not enough?

== Want to control the OS, the JDK, etc.?

[%notitle]
== Docker

image::docker-logo.png[background, size=contain]

== Using Docker and Gradle from TravisCI

[source, yaml]
--
# Using Docker because there's a bug in the default (ancient) environment Travis uses for Java
services:
- docker

before_install:
- docker pull openjdk:8u121-jdk

script:
- docker run -v $HOME/.gradle:/.gradle -v $PWD:/src -w /src openjdk:8u121-jdk ./gradlew -i --no-daemon clean check -g /.gradle

#
# Caching per https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/
#
before_cache:
- rm -f $HOME/.gradle/caches/2.14.1/plugin-resolution/cache.properties.lock
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
  - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/
--

== Still Need MORE Control?

image::Puppet_Master_comic.jpg[]

== There are several powerful Docker plugins

Two of the most popular are

* https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin
* https://github.com/palantir/gradle-docker

They allow you to dynamically create images (with or without an intermediate `Dockerfile`), run images,
push to repositories, etc.

[%notitle]
== Docker Example

For example, you can have a Node, Phantom, Firefox, etc. installed in a Docker image that mounts your Java project
that runs as part of your integration/functional tests, small and fast enough to run regularly on your workstation...


== Docker "`Too Much`"?

You can still easily integrate/control other toolchains

== Need something from Node?

image::node_js.png[role=plain]

[%notitle]
== Node Plugin

The https://github.com/srs/gradle-node-plugin[Gradle Node Plugin] will let you run Node/Grunt/Gulp commands "`as if`"
they were Gradle tasks

* Node need not have been previously installed
* Everything's sandboxed, so you can control the specific versions involved

== Need something from Ruby?

image::Ruby_logo.svg[role=plain]

[%notitle]
== Ruby Plugin

The http://jruby-gradle.org/[Gradle JRuby Plugin] lets you use JRuby to use Ruby "`natively`", including full Gem support


== Lifecycle

image::lifecycle-of-frog-chart.jpg[role=plain]


== The Phases

image::underpants_gnomes.jpg[role=plain, height="400px"]

== First: Evaluation

Assemble the build model (identify the tasks, configuration, what the task execution graph looks like, etc.)

[.smaller]
I'm including build initialization here for simplicity

== Second: Execution

Using the graph built during the Evaluation phase, execute the task actions

== Eval vs Exec Example

[source, groovy]
--
task fooble {
    doLast {
        logger.lifecycle "Running fooble last action"
    }
    doFirst {
        logger.lifecycle "Running fooble first action"
    }
    logger.lifecycle "Configuring fooble"
}
logger.lifecycle "Evaluating project"
--

[source, bash]
--
$ gw fooble
Configuring fooble
Evaluating project
:fooble
Running fooble first action
Running fooble last action

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
--


== Deprecated Left Shift

In older example you will see task declarations like

[source, groovy]
--
task something << {
    // task action
}
--

But it would confuse people, since it wasn't clear how it's different from
[source, groovy]
--
task something {
    // configure the task
}
--

[%notitle]
== Explicit Action

So now the the preferred way is the explicit
[source, groovy]
--
task something {
    doLast {
      // do something
    }
}

// or

task somethingElse()
somethingElse.doLast {
  // do something
}
--

== Eval Ordering

[.smaller]
--
. "```init.gradle```"
** bootstrap overall environment
. "```settings.gradle```"
** identify the `Project` instances that need to be created and how to associate with a `build.gradle`
. "```build.gradle```"'s "```plugins```" and "```pluginRepositories```" blocks
** immutable declaration of plugins for the Project
. "```build.gradle```"'s "```buildscript```" block
** older and more flexible way to set up the Project's classpath (e.g., load libraries and plugins)
. the rest of "```build.gradle```"
--

== Responding to the Lifecycle

* `Project.afterEvaluate`
* `Gradle.taskGraph.whenReady`
* `PluginContainer.withId`
* `DomainObjectCollection.withType`
* `DomainObjectCollection.whenObjectAdded`
* `DomainObjectCollection.whenObjectRemoved`


== Thinking Like A Software Engineer

image::engineer_brain.jpg[role=plain]

[%notitle]
== Build Cleanliness

Just because it's a "`build`", that doesn't mean standard cleanliness rules for software engineering don't apply...

== "```SourceSets```"

These are a poorly understood but awesome feature

Though provided by the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html[Java Plugin (with great docs)],
it certainly isn't limited to Java

They allow for cleanly separating different kinds of source files, like integration tests, acceptance tests, WSDL,
different languages (e.g., Groovy, Clojure, Scala), etc.

== "```Configuration```"

a dynamic sets of artifacts.

[%notitle]
== Configurations for SourceSets

Each `SourceSet` automatically has "```*Compile```", "```*CompileOnly```", and "```*Runtime```" Configurations created

(They are analogous to Maven's "```compile```", "```provided```", and "```runtime```" scopes, respectively.)

[.smaller]
A default application of the "```java```" plugin has two SourceSets: "```main```" and "```test```".
The "```main```" SourceSet is "`implied`" for the automatic configurations. Therefore the "```Configuration```"
instances are "```compile```", "```compileOnly```", "```runtime```", "```testCompile```", "```testCompileOnly```",
and "```testRuntime```".)

== Far more than merely "```scope```"

* They are a fully programmable model, as we'll see

* Can be used for more than just JARs
** For example, https://github.com/palantir/gradle-docker[one of the Docker plugins]
uses a "```docker```" configuration as a simple way to build the "```docker-compose.yml```" file

== Injection

Projects can interact to inject behavior

== Injection Example

[source,groovy]
--
subprojects {
    if (name.contains("-impl") {
        sourceSets {
            intTest
        }

        dependencies {
            intTestCompile "junit:junit:4.12"
        }

        task intTest(type: Test) {
            testClassesDir = sourceSets.intTest.output.classesDir
            classpath = sourceSets.intTest.runtimeClasspath
        }
    }
}
--

== As pseudo-Java

[source,groovy]
--
project.getSubprojects().each(subproject -> {
    if (subproject.getName().contains("-impl") {
        subproject.sourceSets(new Closure(subproject.getSourceSets()) {
            public void call() {
                ((SourceSetContainer)delegate).add("intTest");
            }
        });

        subproject.dependencies(new Closure(subproject.getDependencies()) {
            public void call() {
                ((DependencyHandler)delegate).add("intTestCompile", "junit:junit:4.12");
            }
        });

        subproject.task(Collections.singletonMap("type", Test.class), "intTest", new Closure() {
            // the "delegate" is set on the closure after the factory method creates the Task instance
            public void call() {
                ((Test)delegate).setTestClassesDir(
                    subproject.getSourceSets().getByName("intTest").getOutput().getClassesDir());
                ((Test)delegate).setClasspath(
                    subproject.getSourceSets().getByName("intTest").getRuntimeClasspath());
            }
        });
    }
});

== Modularizing Your Logic

[%notitle]
== Modularizing Your Logic List

For a non-trivial project, there's often a LOT going on:

* compilation
* unit/integration/functional tests
* code generation
* documentation generation
* signing artifacts
* static code analysis
* annotation processors (e.g., Lombok, Checker Framework)
* deployment information
* etc.

[%notitle]
== Go Simple and Modular

Just like everything else in your codebase, your build should be simple and modular

[%notitle]
== Extraction

One of the simplest ways is to extract into fragments

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
--
apply from: "gradle/compile.gradle"
apply from: "gradle/testing.gradle"
apply from: "gradle/documentation.gradle"
// ...
--

[source, groovy]
.gradle/compile.gradle
--
apply plugin: "java"

repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile 'io.javaslang:javaslang:2.0.5'
}
// ...
--


[%notitle]
== Custom Tasks and Plugins

Of course more sophisticated and common needs should be extracted into custom Tasks and Plugins for reuse

== Plugin Registry

There's currently over 1,400 plugins at https://plugins.gradle.org/

== Composite Builds

Beyond multi-module, sometime you have dependencies on independent projects with their own repos and lifecycles...

[%notitle]
== Old Multi-Projects

In the "`olden days`" that meant a workflow like

. change dependency to use -SNAPSHOT
. change to other project and make modifications
. change version to -SNAPSHOT
. build and publish to a local repo
. change back to main project
. recompile and retest
. **rinse and repeat 4-6 as necessary**
. build and deploy a new version to the binary repository of the other project
. update main project to use the new version of the other project


== New Multi-Projects

. change to other project and make modifications
. from main project:
** `gw test --include-build=../other-proj`
. repeat 1-2 as necessary
. build and deploy a new version to the binary repository of the other project
. update main project to use the new version of the other project

== Working With the Dependency Model

[source, groovy]
--
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details ->
        if (details.requested.name == 'groovy-all') {
            //prefer 'groovy' over 'groovy-all':
            details.useTarget group: details.requested.group, name: 'groovy', version: details.requested.version
        }
        if (details.requested.name == 'log4j') {
            //prefer 'log4j-over-slf4j' over 'log4j', with fixed version:
            details.useTarget "org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:1.7.10"
        }
    }
}
dependencies {
    modules {
        module("com.google.collections:google-collections") {
            replacedBy("com.google.guava:guava")
        }
    }
}
--

== Powerful Version Specifications

All of https://ant.apache.org/ivy/[Apache Ivy]'s capabilities and more are available to you

== Dynamic Versions

You *_can_* specify dynamic versions (e.g., "12.3.+", "latest.release", "[2.3, 3.0]", etc.)

[.smaller]
`latest.integration` will resolve the latest `-SNAPSHOT` version

== Don't do it

Unless you're purposely writing a randomness generator, non-determinism is not a desired trait

image:random-number.gif[height=100, role=plain, link="http://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25"]

"`What?!? I didn't change anything. Why are the tests failing when it worked five minutes ago? _[hours later]_ Oh,
now it's bringing in a new version of that library...`"

    id 'groovy'
    id 'com.jfrog.bintray' version '1.7.1'

== Can't Use Variables

One restriction is you can't use a variable for the version

[source, groovy]
--
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.1.0'
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
apply plugin: "kotlin"
// ....
dependencies {
    compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
    compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:$kotlin_version"
}

== Looking at an Alternative DSL

[%notitle]
== Dynamic DSL

While IDE support for Gradle is very good, the dynamic features of Groovy that it uses makes having the full
tooling support Java developers are used to difficult/impossible

[%notitle]
== Java Made Better

Groovy is effectively "`Java Made Better`" with tremendously easier syntax, and an emphasis on dynamic
capabilities

[%notitle]
== Kotlin

https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin], driven mostly by JetBrains (the company behind IntelliJ et-al),
tries to retain that "`much cleaner Java`" feel while also staying statically-typed, leaning toward more
Functional approaches

[.smaller]
Other languages like Scala and Clojure also go much more Functional, willing to give up more on Java integration
(both binary and developer understanding) in order to lean more that direction


== Gradle Script Kotlin

[source]
--
apply {
    plugin("java")
}

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile("junit:junit:4.12")
}

== Daemon

image::deamon-icon.png[role="plain"]

== Benefits

. Startup Speed
** Leaves the process running, so memory already allocated, filesystem has been read, etc.
** Caches information like hashes of inputs/outputs, compiled build scripts, etc.
. Execution Speed
** HotSpot sure likes long-lived processes...
** The incremental compiler **_REALLY_** shines

Perfect for development environments (including IDE tooling), but pretty useless for CI environments

== Plugins Note for the Daemon

When writing a plugin or the like, be careful with the use of "```static```" since the daemon retains
classloaders as part of the caching


== Incremental Mode

Most Tasks define `@Input` properties that let Gradle know when the task is no longer "```UP-TO-DATE```"

If you run Gradle with the '```-t```' command flag, it will continue to run, watching for changes on task inputs and
re-executing them
